# GeePeeTee

A bootleg version of [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT).

A quick and dirty script to give a GPT model (in this case gpt-3.5-turbo) the capability to have short-term
and long-term memory. Could be expanded to give the agent more functionality, e.g. by giving it
the ability to execute commands.
